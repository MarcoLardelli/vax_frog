## Expert system for weather forecasting from observations in the OPS5 production system language

See my [blog post](https://lardel.li/2024/03/first-encounter-with-ai.html) about this project for details.

Written in [OPS5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPS5), a production system computer language to create expert systems.

Unfortunately I have only the printed version left. Therefore PDF only. Sorry.
